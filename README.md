This GitHub repo is to host an exercise for a course I teach. The course is Environmental and Resource Economics to STREEM master students at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

The exercise is on fisheries and on how open access leads to exploitation of the common resource (fish). This repo provides visualizations to this model, including visual solutions.
